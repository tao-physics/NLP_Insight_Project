There are 2 person assist in Memory Care 2 but only have 2 staff. So if the 2 staff go in assist the resident that needs a 2 person assistance, the floor is left unattended. Calling other departments may not be available due to their short staff. There will be other good people that will leave because promises the upper management makes about getting a 3rd person for 2nd shift. And why there are 3 or 4 staff on 1st shift in Memory Care 2. But when it comes to 2nd shift it is only 2 staff. This has been going on for a long time. How could upper management say things will get better in Memory Care. How is that possible when there are 17 residents with different behaviors. A couple of residents can be very aggressive. Doing hourly checks in Memory Care 2 especially when it is bed time.  The staff are required to go into the residents bathroom while he or she sleeps to press a button. The residents gets extremely upset because the staff are disturbing them. If the residents can't get there proper rest means lack of sleep that means the residents does eat well which turns into a decline in health. Hence, It takes some residents awhile to drift off. I do understand why the staff must do it. So when the residents tells the staff not to come back in, but it's our responsibility to make that check visual and press the button in their bathroom,do we do as the request or do what we are instructed to do from upper management.

If a person cannot handle extra tasks on top of their daily schedule there should not be a constant ""push"" to take on extra things including Learning Academy, DOR, being a mentor, Clinical Champion at multiple levels, or Clinical Instructor.  These should be things that the employee does on their own accord and time.  I applaud ""Encouraging the Heart"", however, if the employee has expressed that they cannot do something, understand that it's not the right time. 
Also, I understand the concept of making the work place ""fun"", but participating in the ""Happy Video"" was very embarrassing.  I felt bullied by my supervisor at the time to ""have an idea and theme by Friday"" made as a statement indicating that lack of participation would have consequences.  A team idea was born, however, there was no practice for what we did prior to the video and on the video we were uncoordinated and unprofessional.  I felt embarrassed about the video being posted company-wide and did not feel like I had a voice to opt out of it.  I certainly did not feel ""happy"".  There was a similar vein with requests of pictures of people in ""1999"".  I think for something to be ""fun"" within the company, people should want to actively and genuinely participate.  It should be announced, but there should not be pressure for people to participate that may not feel comfortable doing so.

I work full time for another company and have the opportunity at times to work with folks that have been at this facility for one reason or another. They are resoundingly upset, angry and feel uncared for by the nursing staff. There are also many comments that deal with the cleanliness of their rooms, from trash being emptied to used towels not being picked up. I will say personally in my experience, the professional communication between therapy and nursing is poor. I do not feel the information I give to nursing staff is well received, and then it is hardly followed up on. For instance medications that are late, pain meds needed for clients to be able to participate in therapy or questions family may have of nursing nature that I myself can not address. I have personally heard nurses complaining about their caseloads in the halls in front of patients. I fully realize that Iâ€™m not present in this facility often, and tend to let things go because anyone can have a rough day and possibly Iâ€™ve just been there to observe that nurses rough day. However, when coupled with reports from past clients..I do not believe this is the case. Clients have refused to ever go back and have told their friends and family the same, strictly based on the nursing care. Therapy and food services are always reported as good.

The consistently poor management has created a workplace where no one is expected to show up for their shifts, employee performance (or lack thereof) is not monitored at all, and interdepartmental cooperation is impossible due to total lack of communication. The management does not listen to the employees, so serious problems go ignored until they collapse altogether. The management never follows through on rewards programs, and, as far as I have experienced, creates arbitrary barriers to keep employees from receiving bonuses and their due compensation like PTO pay. The mismanagement of this facility is absolutely irresponsible and the burden of keeping the facility in due operation falls upon the small minority of employees that actually feel personally responsible for maintaining a safe and enjoyable living facility for our residents, and these outgoing employees are treated with the same ignorance and disdain as the rest.

Money is apparently so tight that we're asked to take mandatory training, deemed critically important for upcoming changes in Medicare, on our own time at home! And we are given pages of handouts, on the fly, that we're supposed to read and then suddenly have comprehension of a new process. Should I worry about Infinity's financial solvency? Perhaps this company could invest some time into understanding the best ways to manage change. Yes, it's a challenge because not all of the therapists are present any one day - we provide therapies 7 days per week.
