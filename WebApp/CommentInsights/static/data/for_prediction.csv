6659,74791,One Change,"Need more staff in Memory Care 1 and 2 and also in AL. Good people are leaving to due short staff in all departments. There are 2 person assist in Memory Care 2 but only have 2 staff. So if the 2 staff go in assist the resident that needs a 2 person assistance, the floor is left unattended. Calling other departments may not be available due to their short staff. There will be other good people that will leave because promises the upper management makes about getting a 3rd person for 2nd shift. And why there are 3 or 4 staff on 1st shift in Memory Care 2. But when it comes to 2nd shift it is only 2 staff. This has been going on for a long time. How could upper management say things will get better in Memory Care. How is that possible when there are 17 residents with different behaviors. A couple of residents can be very aggressive. Doing hourly checks in Memory Care 2 especially when it is bed time.  The staff are required to go into the residents bathroom while he or she sleeps to press a button. The residents gets extremely upset because the staff are disturbing them. If the residents can't get there proper rest means lack of sleep that means the residents does eat well which turns into a decline in health. Hence, It takes some residents awhile to drift off. I do understand why the staff must do it. So when the residents tells the staff not to come back in, but it's our responsibility to make that check visual and press the button in their bathroom,do we do as the request or do what we are instructed to do from upper management. We work really hard in Memory Care 2. 2nd shift nor 1st shift still haven't received our appreciation.",Staffing and Scheduling,Negative,12,0

If a person cannot handle extra tasks on top of their daily schedule there should not be a constant ""push"" to take on extra things including Learning Academy, DOR, being a mentor, Clinical Champion at multiple levels, or Clinical Instructor.  These should be things that the employee does on their own accord and time.  I applaud ""Encouraging the Heart"", however, if the employee has expressed that they cannot do something, understand that it's not the right time. 
Also, I understand the concept of making the work place ""fun"", but participating in the ""Happy Video"" was very embarrassing.  I felt bullied by my supervisor at the time to ""have an idea and theme by Friday"" made as a statement indicating that lack of participation would have consequences.  A team idea was born, however, there was no practice for what we did prior to the video and on the video we were uncoordinated and unprofessional.  I felt embarrassed about the video being posted company-wide and did not feel like I had a voice to opt out of it.  I certainly did not feel ""happy"".  There was a similar vein with requests of pictures of people in ""1999"".  I think for something to be ""fun"" within the company, people should want to actively and genuinely participate.  It should be announced, but there should not be pressure for people to participate that may not feel comfortable doing so.

I work full time for another company and have the opportunity at times to work with folks that have been at this facility for one reason or another. They are resoundingly upset, angry and feel uncared for by the nursing staff. There are also many comments that deal with the cleanliness of their rooms, from trash being emptied to used towels not being picked up. I will say personally in my experience, the professional communication between therapy and nursing is poor. I do not feel the information I give to nursing staff is well received, and then it is hardly followed up on. For instance medications that are late, pain meds needed for clients to be able to participate in therapy or questions family may have of nursing nature that I myself can not address. I have personally heard nurses complaining about their caseloads in the halls in front of patients. I fully realize that Iâ€™m not present in this facility often, and tend to let things go because anyone can have a rough day and possibly Iâ€™ve just been there to observe that nurses rough day. However, when coupled with reports from past clients..I do not believe this is the case. Clients have refused to ever go back and have told their friends and family the same, strictly based on the nursing care. Therapy and food services are always reported as good. My feeling is the nature of the nursing department needs to be improved. And quickly if the Suites wants to stand out as a facility among  the numerous other SNF in the immediate area.

Clocking in and out for lunch is often counterproductive to the flow of my day to day duties and inhibits my attention to resident centered care.

I am able to eat sufficiently in small amounts and fit it in and around my on-call duties much more efficiently then removing myself from the community for 30 minutes at a time.
Additionally, I find myself anxious about clocking in at the beginning of the day and out at the end of the day with machine like precision and sometimes short myself minutes a week so that I won't cost the company overtime. Despite typically arriving at work 5-10 minutes early and leaving 5-10 minutes after my shift ends.

The management never follows through on rewards programs, and, as far as I have experienced, creates arbitrary barriers to keep employees from receiving bonuses and their due compensation like PTO pay.

Management is very unprofessional and will gossip. The good employees are the ones used and abused and unappreciated but, if u sit in the admin office and talk to him and whine you get away with everything. Constantly short staffed. Management needs a complete overhaul! Management is not a strong team to lead a building. There is zero Communication between management and the rest of the team. Managment cares only of them selves and not the rest of the team. They have their own clique. Managers do not interact with resident except activities. BOM will close door because she cant work when residents are talking to her. But it's ok for the nurse to be interrupted multiple times while getting meds ready. Managment acts as though they are the gold and the rest of the team is dirt. Managers never solve problems only add them on to other team members. None of the managers are in the building before 10am. And are never on the floor even when we had 3 out of 4 caregivers call off.
